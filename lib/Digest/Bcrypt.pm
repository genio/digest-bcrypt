=head1 NAME

Digest::Bcrypt - Perl interface to the bcrypt digest algorithm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use utf8;
    use Digest;   # via the Digest module (recommended)

    my $bcrypt = Digest->new('Bcrypt', cost => 12, salt => 'abcdefgh♥stuff');
    # You can forego the cost and salt in favor of settings strings:
    my $bcrypt = Digest->new('Bcrypt', settings => '$2a$20$GA.eY03tb02ea0DqbA.eG.');

    # $cost is an integer between 5 and 31
    $bcrypt->cost(12);

    # $type is a selection between 2a, 2b, 2x, and 2y
    $bcrypt->type('2b');

    # $salt must be exactly 16 octets long
    $bcrypt->salt('abcdefgh♥stuff');
    # OR, for good, random salts:
    use Data::Entropy::Algorithms qw(rand_bits);
    $bcrypt->salt(rand_bits(16*8)); # 16 octets

    # You can forego the cost and salt in favor of settings strings:
    $bcrypt->settings('$2a$20$GA.eY03tb02ea0DqbA.eG.');

    # add some strings we want to make a secret of
    $bcrypt->add('some stuff', 'here and', 'here');

    my $digest = $bcrypt->digest;
    $digest = $bcrypt->hexdigest;
    $digest = $bcrypt->b64digest;

    # bcrypt's own non-standard base64 dictionary
    $digest = $bcrypt->bcrypt_b64digest;

    # Now, let's create a password hash and check it later:
    use Data::Entropy::Algorithms qw(rand_bits);
    my $bcrypt = Digest->new('Bcrypt', type => '2b', cost => 20, salt => rand_bits(16*8));
    my $settings = $bcrypt->settings(); # save for later checks.
    my $pass_hash = $bcrypt->add('Some secret password')->digest;

    # much later, we can check a password against our hash via:
    my $bcrypt = Digest->new('Bcrypt', settings => $settings);
    if ($bcrypt->add($value_from_user)->digest eq $known_pass_hash) {
        say "Your password matched";
    }
    else {
        say "Try again!";
    }

    # Now that you've seen how cumbersome/silly that is,
    # please use Crypt::Bcrypt instead of this module.

=head1 NOTICE

While maintenance for L<Digest::Bcrypt> will continue, there's no reason to use
L<Digest::Bcrypt> when L<Crypt::Bcrypt> already exists.  We strongly suggest
that you use L<Crypt::Bcrypt> instead.

This C<Digest::Bcrypt> interface is crufty and laborious to use when compared
to that of L<Crypt::Bcrypt>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Digest::Bcrypt> provides a L<Digest>-based interface to the
L<Crypt::Bcrypt> library.

Please note that you B<must> set a C<salt> of exactly 16 octets in length,
and you B<must> provide a C<cost> in the range C<1..31>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Digest::Bcrypt> implements the following attributes.

=head2 cost

    $bcrypt = $bcrypt->cost(20); # allows for method chaining
    my $cost = $bcrypt->cost();

An integer in the range C<5..31>, this is required.

See L<Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt> for a detailed description of C<cost>
in the context of the bcrypt algorithm.

When called with no arguments, it will return the current cost.

=head2 salt

    $bcrypt = $bcrypt->salt('abcdefgh♥stuff'); # allows for method chaining
    my $salt = $bcrypt->salt();

    # OR, for good, random salts:
    use Data::Entropy::Algorithms qw(rand_bits);
    $bcrypt->salt(rand_bits(16*8)); # 16 octets

Sets the value to be used as a salt. Bcrypt requires B<exactly> 16 octets of salt.

It is recommenced that you use a module like L<Data::Entropy::Algorithms> to
provide a truly randomized salt.

When called with no arguments, it will return the current salt.

=head2 settings

    $bcrypt = $bcrypt->settings('$2a$20$GA.eY03tb02ea0DqbA.eG.'); # allows for method chaining
    my $settings = $bcrypt->settings();

A C<settings> string can be used to set the L<Digest::Bcrypt/salt> and
L<Digest::Bcrypt/cost> automatically. Setting the C<settings> will override any
current values in your C<cost> and C<salt> attributes.

For details on the C<settings> string requirements, please see L<Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt>.

When called with no arguments, it will return the current settings string.

=head2 type

    $bcrypt = $bcrypt->type('2b');
    # method chaining on mutations
    say $bcrypt->type(); # 2b

This sets the subtype of bcrypt used. These subtypes are as defined in L<Crypt::Bcrypt>.
The available types are:
C<2b> which is the current standard,
C<2a> which is older; it's the one used in L<Crypt::Eksblowfish>,
C<2y> which is considered equivalent to C<2b> and used in PHP.
C<2x> which is very broken and only needed to work with ancient PHP versions.

=head1 METHODS

L<Digest::Bcrypt> inherits all methods from L<Digest::base> and implements/overrides
the following methods as well.

=head2 new

    my $bcrypt = Digest->new('Bcrypt', %params);
    my $bcrypt = Digest::Bcrypt->new(%params);
    my $bcrypt = Digest->new('Bcrypt', \%params);
    my $bcrypt = Digest::Bcrypt->new(\%params);

Creates a new C<Digest::Bcrypt> object. It is recommended that you use the L<Digest>
module in the first example rather than using L<Digest::Bcrypt> directly.

Any of the L<Digest::Bcrypt/ATTRIBUTES> above can be passed in as a parameter.

=head2 add

    $bcrypt->add("a"); $bcrypt->add("b"); $bcrypt->add("c");
    $bcrypt->add("a")->add("b")->add("c");
    $bcrypt->add("a", "b", "c");
    $bcrypt->add("abc");

Adds data to the message we are calculating the digest for. All the above
examples have the same effect.

=head2 b64digest

    my $digest = $bcrypt->b64digest;

Same as L</"digest">, but will return the digest base64 encoded.

The C<length> of the returned string will be 31 and will only contain characters
from the ranges C<'0'..'9'>, C<'A'..'Z'>, C<'a'..'z'>, C<'+'>, and C<'/'>

The base64 encoded string returned is not padded to be a multiple of 4 bytes long.

=head2 bcrypt_b64digest

    my $digest = $bcrypt->bcrypt_b64digest;

Same as L</"digest">, but will return the digest base64 encoded using the alphabet
that is commonly used with bcrypt.

The C<length> of the returned string will be 31 and will only contain characters
from the ranges C<'0'..'9'>, C<'A'..'Z'>, C<'a'..'z'>, C<'+'>, and C<'.'>

The base64 encoded string returned is not padded to be a multiple of 4 bytes long.

I<Note:> This is bcrypt's own non-standard base64 alphabet, It is B<not>
compatible with the standard MIME base64 encoding.

=head2 clone

    my $clone = $bcrypt->clone;

Creates a clone of the C<Digest::Bcrypt> object, and returns it.

=head2 digest

    my $digest = $bcrypt->digest;

Returns the binary digest for the message. The returned string will be 23 bytes long.

=head2 hexdigest

    my $digest = $bcrypt->hexdigest;

Same as L</"digest">, but will return the digest in hexadecimal form.

The C<length> of the returned string will be 46 and will only contain
characters from the ranges C<'0'..'9'> and C<'a'..'f'>.

=head2 reset

    $bcrypt->reset;

Resets the object to the same internal state it was in when it was constructed.
